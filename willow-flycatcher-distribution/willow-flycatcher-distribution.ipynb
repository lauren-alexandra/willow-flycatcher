    "#### Species Description\n",
    "Willow Flycatchers (*Empidonax traillii*) specialize in areas with willows and other shrubs [near running and still water](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/willow-flycatcher). They are about 6 inches in length with brown, gray, and white plumage, a rounded wing, and a square-tipped tail. Calls are in the form of a chirp, buzz, or trill and match an undulating pattern. Nests are placed 4-15 feet above water or damp ground and constructed as an open cup of grass, bark, and plant fibers. The species migrates long distances, breeding in the U.S. and Canada and wintering in Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. They are common in most locations in their range despite a [25% decline](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Willow_Flycatcher/lifehistory) in population between 1966 to 2019. The loss of wet marshes, wet meadows, and riparian vegetation has contributed to [declining species abundance](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/tahoe/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprdb5357314#:~:text=The%20scientific%20name%20for%20willow,t). According to the Bird Genoscape Project, there are seven geneticially [distinct populations](https://www.birdgenoscape.org/willow-flycatcher/) of Willow Flycatcher in North America: the Pacific Northwest, Kern, California, southern California, White Mountain, Arizona, Interior West, Southwest, and Eastern. However, there are only four recognized subspecies: *E. t. brewsteri*, *E. t. adastus*, *E. t. extimus*, and *E. t. traillii*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my home state of California, there are three [endangered subspecies](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/tahoe/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprdb5357314#:~:text=The%20scientific%20name%20for%20willow,t): Southwestern Willow Flycatcher in central and southern California (Federal and State), Little Willow Flycatcher in high elevation Sierra Nevada (State), and Great Basin Willow Flycatcher in desert riparian area (State). Researchers have found that the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher has a higher prevalence of gene variants today compared to 100 years ago that are associated with [adapting to wet and humid conditions](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/endangered-willow-flycatchers-in-san-diego-are-adapting-to-climate-change/). This difference is likely due to interbreeding with species in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest, producing an evolutionary response to climate change. Adaptations like these are why it is vital to preserve the interconnectivity of species populations through the protection of habitat and landscape mobility.\n",

    "#### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GBIF Occurrence dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.jqrwjf) was retrived from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility Occurrence Store and is scoped to the year of interest (2023) and species under observation. There are 110,725 species occurrences total which are indicated by geographic coordinates spanning across five aggregated datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [RESOLVE Ecoregions dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/RESOLVE_ECOREGIONS_2017) (2017) depicts Earth's 846 terrestrial ecoregions and was obtained as a shapefile. Ecoregions represent boundaries formed by biotic and abiotic conditions: geology, landforms, soils, vegetation, land use, wildlife, climate, and hydrology.\n",
